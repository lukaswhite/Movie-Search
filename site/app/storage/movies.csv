Byung-sik is an older housemaid who has been with this family for a long time and holds many secrets. But soon enough, the master of the house, Hoon, takes advantage of his social position by slipping into the new housemaid's bed. Hoon's visits become frequent and Byung-sik reports the affair to Hae-ra's mother Mi-hee, who plots to give Hae-ra the control over her husband. Soon Eun-yi becomes pregnant by Hoon and wants to keep the baby. This is discovered by the family and Eun-yi is forced by Mi-hee to have an abortion despite the young woman's pleas to let her keep the baby and leave the house. Her forced abortion turns Eun-yi's already fragile mental condition for the worse and she decides to take the matter into her own hands... -- (C) IFC";"Jeon Do-yeon";"Lee Jung-Jae";"Youn Yuh-jung";"Woo Seo";"Park Ji-young"

For eight months, the Professor, Pirate, Fuzzy Wuzzy Stanley, Cliff, Halbert, Clydesdale, Carms and many others were followed as they survived daily on the streets of Isla Vista, California. As these urban denizens open their hearts and reveal their pasts, discover the soul-crushing events that changed the trajectory of their lives forever. Marvel at how all of us are just one step away from joining them as society's forgotten children. Being Houseless will never be looked upon the same way again.";"Ted Williams";;;;

The younger generation at the Patiala House wants to assert themselves and follow their dreams but are held back by their respect and love for Bauji and the shining example of Bauji's eldest son, Parghat Singh Kahlon aka Gattu (Akshay Kumar). Gattu gave up his dream at the altar of Bauji's biases. His reward: For the last 17 years he has opened the corner store across the tube station. He will tend to his customers, hear the neighbourhood boys playing cricket in the back alley. He will remember a dream that could have become a reality and watch his father rule a house, a family, a community like he has for the last 25 years. He will silently tolerate the snide remarks and insults passed by a younger generation. He will understand the bitterness of his siblings and identify with their shattered dreams. Then he will participate to bring forth a change. He will finally summon the courage to challenge his father and start a movement that will shake the very foundations of Patiala House. Will Bauji loosen his hold and let the youngsters find their own dreams instead of following his? Will Gattu get a second chance to live his life? What's more important: family or dreams? And why must we choose one over the other. 'Patiala House' has been inspired by England cricket team's Sikh member Monty Singh Panesar.

In his compelling new film 20 FEET FROM STARDOM, award-winning director Morgan Neville shines a spotlight on the untold true story of the backup singers behind some of the greatest musical legends of the 21st century. Triumphant and heartbreaking in equal measure, the film is both a tribute to the unsung voices who brought shape and style to popular music and a reflection on the conflicts, sacrifices and rewards of a career spent harmonizing with others. These gifted artists span a range of styles, genres and eras of popular music, but each has a uniquely fascinating and personal story to share of life spent in the shadows of superstardom. Along with rare archival footage and a peerless soundtrack, 20 FEET FROM STARDOM boasts intimate interviews with Bruce Springsteen, Stevie Wonder, Mick Jagger and Sting to name just a few. However, these world-famous figures take a backseat to the diverse array of backup singers whose lives and stories take center stage in the film.

But her younger sister Jessica (Danielle Campbell) doesn't want anything to do with her older sibling's obsession.

He can't open the medicine cabinet, can't pick up a Perrier bottle, can't even feed his fish! A naturally nervous person, Nick panics. Suddenly, a British glam-rock band bursts in the door. The band informs Nick that he is dead, and he's stuck in his apartment. To escape, he must learn all the valuable life lessons he ignored while he was alive. Then, he will be judged by God and sent either to Heaven or Hell - a jarring concept for an atheist. With the rock band serving as his modern-day Greek chorus, Nick must rely on Rex, the hot-headed, half-drunken lead singer as his spiritual guide to avoid the fiery pits of Hell. Further complicating matters is the new tenant, Beth.

Unable to convince anyone that he's telling the truth, Charlie has to find a way to get rid of the monster himself in this revamp of the comedy-horror classic. -- (C) DreamWorks";"Anton Yelchin";"Colin Farrell";"Toni Collette";"David Tennant";"Imogen Poots"

Tenney's influential 1988 horror classic. Everyone in New Orleans knows the dark story of Broussard Mansion, but none of the locals have dared set foot in the notorious estate...until now. Angela Feld has chosen Broussard Mansion as the setting for this year's annual Halloween bash. No one throws a party quite like Angela, and when her friends catch wind of the plan, curiosity takes precedence over fear. Later that night, the party is packed and the music is blasting when the police show up to spoil the fun and send everyone packing. The only ones left behind are Angela, Maddie, Lily, Suzanne, Colin, Dex, and Jason, and they're not ready to call it a night just yet. Upon venturing down into the basement, Colin and Angela make a grisly discovery that sets into motion a diabolical series of events. There is no escape from the fear that follows next, because as the doors of Broussard Mansion mysteriously lock, a horde of ancient demons rise from the darkness to unleash the infernal powers of Hell on the desperate teens, who will fight to the death to protect their immortal souls.

Harmon is a former Marine, radicalized by tours of duty overseas. His life in the military is behind him, but at heart he remains the same reckless alpha male he always was, eager for adventure, excited by the prospect of mayhem and destruction. Dena is a high society dropout, sickened by the consumer economy into which she was born. She's moved west and cut ties with her family, edging ever deeper into radical politics. And Josh, their leader, is a self-made militant, devoted to the protection of the Earth by any means necessary. A son of the middle class who works on an organic farm, he's an intensely private person by nature and may have the deepest convictions of them all. NIGHT MOVES is a tale of suspense and a meditation on the consequences of political extremism. When do legitimate convictions truly demand illegal behaviors?

This verite-style documentary explores a theatrical game in which participants dress and act like vampires, and fight it out using paper-rock-scissors. Live Action Roleplaying has created a subculture in the Twin Cities and beyond. The film follows Jesse Aubart and the game he organizes from the Macalester College Campus to the Minnesota Design Center. Jesse is in charge as fantasy writer Scott Lynch plays the role of Prince of the Vampires. We see how friendships change as Scott struggles to keep his throne, and Jesse struggles to keep order as other characters battle for the throne.";;;;;

A hit at the Berlin Film Festival, the film extends the earlier shadow puppet style of Ocelot's Princes and Princesses, with black silhouetted characters set off against exquisitely detailed Day-Glo backgrounds bursting with color and kaleidoscopic patterns - the subtle use of 3D creating a diorama-like effect. The film weaves together six exotic fables each unfolding in a unique locale, from Tibet, to medieval Europe, an Aztec kingdom, the African plains, and even the Land of the Dead. In Ocelot's storytelling, history blends with fairytale as viewers are whisked off to enchanted lands full of dragons, werewolves, captive princesses, sorcerers, and enormous talking bees - and each fable ends with its own ironic twist. -- (C) GKIDS";"Julien Beramis";"Marine Griset";"Michael Elias";"Michel Ocelot";"Isabelle Guiard"

Her waking hours filled mourning the death of her late husband and her dreams haunted by visions of the creatures that turned him into a monster, Stella becomes the subject of much ridicule when she makes it her mission to convince the public that vampires truly exist. But just as the embarrassment is becoming too much to handle, three strangers (Harold Perrineau, Diora Baird and Rhys Coiro) present Stella with an opportunity to seek revenge by killing Lilith (Mia Kirshner), the vampire queen behind the Barstow massacre. Armed to the teeth and ready to die fighting, the brave quartet descends into the sewers beneath Los Angeles and begins their search for the elusive Lilith. But should she manage to find them first, the vampires will once again gain the upper hand. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi";"Kiele Sanchez";"Mia Kirshner";"Rhys Coiro";"Diora Baird";"Harold Perrineau Jr."

16562;Nightfall;2012;R;70;"Isaac Asimov's classic science fiction story ""Nightfall"" posited a world bathed in perpetual sunlight because of its six suns, which are all in constant orbit so one is always shining. But once every 2,000 years or so there is an eclipse that throws the plant into darkness and drives people mad. Asimov is after a comparison of religious superstition and scientific knowledge here, centered on the poetic sense of awe evoked when darkness falls and the stars are visible for the first time. The present filmed version loses all the poetry, exacting science, and subtlety of its inspiration and adds instead the wooden, uncommitted acting of David Carradine (Kung Fu) as a scientist, hordes of Indian extras (it seems to have been filmed in Bombay), and some botched pyrotechnic battle sequences. Clearly the filmmakers lost their way from story to screen, opting instead for a Raiders of the Lost Ark feeling, with lots of lame action and adventure usurping the story's core concept. The Asimov story has garnered top honors in poll after poll, including one done by the Science Fiction Writers of America, and the packaging tries to capitalize on that cachet. Understandable, since this movie has nothing else going for it. --Jim Gay";"Jennifer Burns";"David Carradine";"Linden Dalecki";"Joseph Hodge";"Joe Caliguire"

His mission: to find a mate, settle down and raise a chick. But can he survive the numerous predators and the harsh conditions on an isolated island at the bottom of the world? This is the journey of a typical bachelor King Penguin from awkward adolescent to accomplished adult. It's a family tale, of love and adventure, tragedy and triumph - all told through the charismatic and charming natural actors, the penguins of South Georgia. Stunning cinematography takes us into Penguin City, on an extraordinary sub-Antarctic island, home to majestic albatrosses, brawling elephant seals - and six million penguins. Narrator Tim Allen (Disney Nature's Chimpanzee, Pixar's Toy Story) brings added warmth and humor to the tale, aided by a funny and dramatic script by Phillip LaZebnik (Pocahontas, Mulan, Prince of Egypt). Though our hero's harsh world may be alien to our day-to-day lives, his struggle will be familiar to us all. (c) Cinedigm";"Tim Allen";"David Attenborough";;;

His illustrations have been featured in The New York Times, The Village Voice, Vogue, Rolling Stone, Vanity Fair, Penthouse, and National Lampoon. Since 1981, when his political cartoon Plymptoons was syndicated nationally, he has become a major force and inspiration in the animation world. His work is recognized instantly: he's the guy behind the animated morphing heads, which became famous on MTV, as well as the opening credit sequence for ""The Simpsons"" episode Beware My Cheating Bart. Moving into motion pictures, Plympton earned two Academy Award nominations, has directed and animated over sixty animation shorts, live-action features, music videos, commercials and documentaries, including: ONE OF THOSE DAYS, HOW TO KISS, 25 WAYS TO QUIT SMOKING, PLYMPTOONS, THE TUNE and MUTANT ALIENS He's the only artist to have animated six feature length films- all by himself. ADVENTURES IN PLYMPTOONS! goes deep inside the method and madness of America's most independent animator, creatively incubated in his hometown of Portland, Oregon. Interviews with many of Plympton's collaborators, such as Tom Kenny (voice of SpongeBob SquarePants), David Silverman (Director THE SIMPSONS MOVIE), Terry Gilliam (Director, MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL), Martha Plimpton ('RAISING HOPE'), Matthew Modine (FULL METAL JACKET), Ed Begley, Jr., Peter Jason, Moby and ""Weird Al"" Yankovic, offer candid and comic insights into the irreverent man who has become an international success by not selling out.";"Bill Plympton";"Tom Kenny";"Terry Gilliam";"Weird Al Yankovic";Moby

But being Spider-Man comes at a price: only Spider-Man can protect his fellow New Yorkers from the formidable villains that threaten the city. With the emergence of Electro (Jamie Foxx), Peter must confront a foe far more powerful than he. And as his old friend, Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), returns, Peter comes to realize that all of his enemies have one thing in common: OsCorp.

When Ben Talbot (Simon Merrells) vanishes into thin air, his brother Lawrence (Benicio Del Toro) returns to his family estate to investigate. Upon reuniting with his estranged father, Sir John Talbot (Anthony Hopkins), however, he discovers a destiny far darker than his blackest nightmares. Ben is dead; the victim of a savage attack by a beast that keeps the superstitious locals cowering in fear every time the moon shines bright in the sky. Shortly after discovering his brother's true fate, Lawrence swears to Ben's wife, Gwen (Emily Blunt), that he will bring her late husband's killer to justice. As a young boy, the untimely death of his mother caused Lawrence to grow up before his time. Though Lawrence had previously attempted to bury his pain in the past by leaving the quiet Victorian hamlet of Blackmoor behind, he discovers that you can't outrun fate when he's attacked by the very same nocturnal beast that claimed his brother. Not even recently arrived Scotland Yard inspector Aberline (Hugo Weaving) can dream up a rational explanation for the gruesome spell cast over Blackmoor, yet rumors of an ancient curse persist. According to legend, the afflicted will experience a horrific transformation by the light of the full moon. Now, the woman Talbot loves is in mortal danger, and in order to protect her he must venture into the moonlit woods and destroy the beast before it destroys her. But this isn't a typical hunt, because before the beast can be slain, a simple man will uncover a primal side of himself that he never knew existed.

The year was 2003. As prohibitively expensive technology became affordable to the masses and the Internet made it easy to stay in touch with people who were halfway across the world, Harvard undergrad and computer programming wizard Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) launched a website with the potential to alter the very fabric of our society. At the time, Zuckerberg was just six years away from making his first million. But his hearty payday would come at a high price, because despite all of Zuckerberg's wealth and success, his personal life began to suffer as he became mired in legal disputes, and discovered that many of the 500 million people he had friended during his rise to the top were eager to see him fall. Chief among that growing list of detractors was Zuckerberg's former college friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), whose generous financial contributions to Facebook served as the seed that helped the company to sprout. And some might argue that Zuckerberg's bold venture wouldn't have evolved into the cultural juggernaut that it ultimately became had Napster founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake) not spread the word about Facebook to the venture capitalists from Silicon Valley. Meanwhile, the Winklevoss twins (Armie Hammer and Josh Pence) engage Zuckerberg in a fierce courtroom battle for ownership of Facebook that left many suspecting the young entrepreneur might have let his greed eclipse his better judgment.

Part of its legacy was the forced exodus of displaced sharecroppers, who left plantation life and migrated to Northern cities, adapting to an industrial society with its own set of challenges. Musically, the Great Migration fueled the evolution of acoustic blues to electric blues bands that thrived in cities like Memphis, Detroit and Chicago becoming the wellspring for R&B and rock as well as developing jazz styles. THE GREAT FLOOD is a collaboration between filmmaker and multimedia artist Bill Morrison and guitarist and composer Bill Frisell inspired by the 1927 catastrophe. In the spring of 2011, as the Mississippi River was again flooding to levels not seen since 1927, Frisell, Morrison, and the band traveled together from New Orleans, through Vicksburg, Clarksdale, Memphis, Davenport, Iowa, St. Louis and on up to Chicago. For the film, Morrison scoured film archives, including the Fox Movietone Newsfilm Library and the National archives, for footage of the Mississippi River Flood. All film documenting this catastrophe was shot on volatile nitrate stock, and what footage remains is pock marked and partially deteriorated. The degraded filmstock figures prominently in Morrison's aesthetic with distorted images suggesting different planes of reality in the story-those lived, dreamt, or remembered.(c) Icarus";;;;;
